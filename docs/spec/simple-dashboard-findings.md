# Simple Dashboard — Findings (PR 2 input)

> Seed file created per spec §0. Pre-existing bugs, limitations, and
> improvement opportunities discovered during the dashboard work are **logged
> here, never fixed on this branch**. This is the input to PR 2. It is expected
> to be non-empty when the branch is declared ready.

Scope rule (spec §0): a bug or limitation is **fixed only if this branch
introduced it**. Anything pre-existing is appended below instead.

Findings are added by specialists as they encounter them, and by the
orchestrator during review/verification. Format: what, where, why out of scope
for PR 1, suggested severity.

## Findings

_(populated as work packages proceed)_

### WP-2 — Additive handler fields + FR-14 validation

- **`endpointsStatusHandler` dereferences `a.statsCollector` without a nil guard**
  (`internal/app/handlers/handler_status_endpoints.go`). Pre-existing: the
  handler already called `a.statsCollector.GetEndpointStats()` unconditionally
  before this branch. WP-2 added `a.statsCollector.GetConnectionStats()` in the
  same pattern (required to populate the new `active_connections` field), so the
  latent nil-panic surface is unchanged but is now exercised by one more call.
  A nil `statsCollector` is not a configuration the application constructs in
  production (the DI container always wires one), so this is theoretical. Fixing
  it would mean editing this handler defensively, which is out of scope
  (additive-only). Severity: low.

- **`buildStatusResponse` dereferences `a.Config` without a nil guard**
  (`internal/app/handlers/handler_status.go:157`, `a.Config.Proxy`). Pre-existing
  on main. Out of scope for the same reason. Severity: low.

- **`parseTimeAgoOptimised` is a coarse heuristic**
  (`internal/app/handlers/handler_status_models.go`). Pre-existing: it buckets
  relative-time strings (e.g. every "N seconds" maps to `now-30s`, every
  "N minutes" with single-digit N uses only the first character). WP-2 added a
  name-based tiebreaker to `getRecentModels` so observable ordering is now
  deterministic (FR-15), but the underlying precision loss in the comparator
  remains. Replacing it with a real `time.Time` comparison would require
  threading the absolute timestamp through `ModelSummary` as the sort key, which
  is a refactor beyond the additive brief. Severity: low (cosmetic, only
  affects recent-models ordering within a coarse time bucket).
