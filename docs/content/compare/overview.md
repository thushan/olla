# Olla vs Alternative Solutions

## Quick Comparison Matrix

This guide helps you understand how Olla compares to other tools in the LLM infrastructure space. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and often these tools work better together than in competition.

| Tool | Primary Focus | Best For | Deployment | Language |
|------|--------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **[Olla](https://github.com/thushan/olla)** | Load balancing & failover for existing endpoints | Self-hosted LLM reliability | Single binary | Go |
| **[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)** | API translation & provider abstraction | Multi-cloud API unification | Python package/server | Python |
| **[GPUStack](https://github.com/gpustack/gpustack)** | GPU cluster orchestration | Deploying models across GPUs | Platform | Go |
| **[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)** | Local model serving | Running models locally | Single binary | Go |
| **[LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI)** | OpenAI-compatible local API | Drop-in OpenAI replacement | Container/binary | Go |
| **[Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)** | Web interface for models | Interactive model testing | Python application | Python |
| **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)** | High-performance inference | Production inference serving | Python package | Python/C++ |

## What Makes Olla Different?

Olla focuses on a specific problem: **making your existing LLM infrastructure reliable and manageable**. 

We don't try to:

- Deploy models (that's GPUStack's job)
- Translate APIs (that's LiteLLM's strength)  
- Serve models (that's Ollama/vLLM's purpose)

Instead, we excel at:

- **Intelligent failover** - When your primary GPU dies, we instantly route to backups
- **Production resilience** - Circuit breakers, health checks, connection pooling
- **Minimal overhead** - <2ms latency, ~40MB memory
- **Simple deployment** - Single binary, containerised, YAML config, no dependencies

## Common Scenarios

### "I have multiple machines running Ollama"
**Perfect for Olla!** Point Olla at all your Ollama instances and get automatic failover, load balancing, and unified access.

### "I need to use OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models"
**Use Olla with native [LiteLLM](./litellm.md) support**: Olla now includes native LiteLLM integration. Configure LiteLLM as a backend type alongside your local endpoints for seamless routing between local and cloud models.

### "I have a cluster of GPUs to manage"
**Use [GPUStack](./gpustack.md) + Olla**: GPUStack orchestrates model deployment across GPUs, Olla provides the reliable routing layer on top.

### "I just want to run models locally"
**Start with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)/[LocalAI](./localai.md)**: These are model servers. Add Olla when you need failover or have multiple instances.

└── Cloud: LiteLLM → OpenAI/Anthropic
```

## When NOT to Use Olla

Let's be honest about when Olla isn't the right choice:

- **Single endpoint only**: If you'll only ever have one LLM endpoint, Olla adds unnecessary complexity
- **Need API translation**: If your main need is converting between API formats, [LiteLLM](./litellm.md) is purpose-built for this
- **GPU orchestration**: If you need to deploy/manage models across GPUs, [GPUStack](./gpustack.md) or Kubernetes is what you want
- **Serverless/Lambda**: Olla is designed for persistent infrastructure, not serverless

## Philosophy

We built Olla to do one thing really well: make LLM infrastructure reliable. We're not trying to replace other tools - we want to make them work better together. The LLM ecosystem is complex enough without tools trying to do everything.
